This adds a `package.json` file so it can easily be added as an NPM
dependency.

#### New release?
In the event the library has an update. You might want to pull down the
latest files. I've added a shell script for convienience.  Obviously
this will only handle updates to existing lib files.

```
$ sh setup/setup.sh
```
